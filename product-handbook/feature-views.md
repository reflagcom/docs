# Feature views

## What are views?

Views group features in a single view to let you organize features as well as enable and customize Slack reporting and column configurations.

## Creating views

You can create and manage views in the [App Settings](https://app.reflag.com/env-current/settings/app-stages). You can create new views, edit existing views, and enable weekly reporting to Slack.

## Adding and removing flags to views

To add a flag to a view, go to the [flag](https://app.reflag.com/env-current/features) you want to add to a view. In the right-hand sidebar, click on the + icon beside "Add to views" to add it to a view. You'll have the option to select an existing view or create a new one.

You can remove a feature from a view simply by clicking on the X icon.
