# Creating segments

## What's a segment?

Segments are reusable lists of companies created based off one of more of the following:

* [Company attributes](concepts/company.md#attributes)&#x20;
* Feature access
* Feature metrics
* Feature feedback

Company segments can be used as access rule for managing feature access.

## Getting started <a href="#get-started" id="get-started"></a>

* Go to the `Companies` page on the sidebar
* Click on the `Add filter +` menu item to build your segment conditions

## Set segment conditions

Each segment is created using a set of conditions. You can add as many segmentation conditions as youâ€™d like.&#x20;

### Conditions

There are 4 types of conditions:

* `Company attribute`
  * `Company ID`
