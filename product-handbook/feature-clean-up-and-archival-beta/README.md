# Feature clean-up and archival

## Stale features

After features have been rolled out to everyone, they turn stale after a given period of time. Stale features show up with a little broom next to their name and you also receive a Slack notification if the Slack notification is enabled

## Stale features view

The stale features view lets you see all the features that are currently stale as well as what needs to be done before they can be archived

## Clean-up guide

Open up a feature and find the built in "Clean-up guide". The "Clean-up guide" helps you through the steps required to safely archive a feature.

There are three **checks** that must pass for the feature to be safe to archive:

* Stale: Feature was rolled out to everyone some time ago
* Flag removed from the code in a GitHub repository
* No access checks for some time

There are two **automations** that can be enabled at the feature level:

* Auto-creating a Pull Request once the feature turns stale
* Auto-archiving once all checks pass

See the [AI code clean-up](ai-code-clean-up-beta.md) page for more information on automating code clean-up

## Organization clean-up settings

In organization settings, you control requirements for each checks to pass:

* Configure how soon after rollout features should be considered stale
* If GitHub is connected, you'll see which repository will be checked for the presence of flags
* How long to wait for the last access check

You can also set the default automation settings for newly created features.
