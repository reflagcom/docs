description: Integrate Slack to get notified about new feature changes and feedback
---

# Slack

With the integration for Slack, you can get notifications whenever a feature's access and/or stage changes and whenever an end-user submit feature feedback. You can also get a feature view report.

## Authenticate with Slack

Authentication happens at the environment level. Once you've authenticated, all environments, apps and features can be connected to Slack.

* Go to **Settings**
* Select **Slack** under Environment.

## Choose default Slack channel

You can set a default Slack channel for an app. This means that all features within the app will all inherit the default channel unless you overwrite it.

* Go to Settings
* Select **Slack** under **Environment: Production**

Note: Slack notifications are only supported in the Production [environment](../product-handbook/concepts/environment.md).
